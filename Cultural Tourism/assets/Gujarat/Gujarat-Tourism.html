Your visit to Gujrat  cannot be justified if you miss the important places to visit in Gujrat. To understand the essence of the culture and heritage of Gujarat, the lives of the people and the present state of Gujarat, you need to be on a long vacation. Exploring Gujarat will be a great experience and rewarding as well. The state, rightly called the ‘Jewel of the West’ has a lot to offer for everyone. Constructions that represent diversified faiths, palaces that depict the heroic past, beaches that let you unwind and relax and last but not the least, the beautiful nature’s generosity in various parts of the state await visitors to be explored and enjoyed. A state that currently sets a rich example in progressive industrialization needs to be visited when you have time at your disposal. <br>
                    <br>It is a difficult task to shortlist 8 attractions amongst the innumerable tourist spots. However, here is an earnest and humble effort to provide you with a list. However, the suggestion would be to make your visits based on the purpose of your travel. If it is a heritage tour, you could go all out to visit the heritage sites in Gujarat. If you seek to visit temples, mosques, or both, you will find that you are short of time as the state has various temples and mosques. If wildlife is your passion, you have a lot to keep you moving. If you want somewhere quiet to spend your holiday in a relaxed place and rejuvenate your tired soul after a hectic schedule, you will find in Gujarat various tourist spots to suit your needs.

The sheer simplicity and amiability of Gujaratis have made them a flourishing community. The state of Gujarat boasts a vibrant art, architecture, culture, and heritage; all of which is quite evident in the day-to-day lives of the locals. The diversity exhibited by Gujarat is a result of the various ethnic groups constituting Gujarat's population; including Indic and Dravidian groups.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

          <br>
          <br>The vast array of handcrafted products displaying intricate Gujarati art forms are not only popular in our country, but are a well-known entity all across the globe. These products include furniture, jewellery, embroidered garments, leatherwork, metalwork, baked clay articles and mirror work. Gujarat serves as the producer of some of the most creative and elegant furnishings that include bedcovers, quilts, cushion covers and table mats. Intricate dainty patterns are woven on the&nbsp;patola sarees&nbsp;with high precision. The traditional art forms of the state play a significant role in preserving its rich heritage.<br>
          <br>
          <br>The folk music of Gujarat is known as Sugam Sangeet and has acclaimed world-wide fame. The range of musical instruments utilized in Gujarati folk music includes turi, manjira, ektaro, jantar, zanz pot drum, prabhati, dhol and ravan hattho. Bhajans are also incorporated in their folk songs. Bardic tradition is another major type of folk Gujarati music.<br>
          <br>
          <br>Since Gujarati people are quite enthusiastic and amiable, they have many traditional forms of dance. The four major forms of dance are Dandiya Raas, Garba, Padhar, and Garbi.<br>

For your information, there is a Little Rann of Kutch as well. Great Rann of Kutch measures over 16000 sq. kms and this is the largest salt desert in the world. The massive area is packed with white salt except during monsoon times in India when the desert is filled with waters. The right time to visit the place would be on a full moon day when the place looks glorious in moonlight. The sunrise and sunset on Great Rann of Kutch is a feast to your eyes and they elevate your spirits as well. It would be great if you visit this place by the end of December to experience the cultural extravaganza organized by the government. The luxury tents set up by the government will make your stay comfortable.<br>

The real discovery channel of India is situated approximately 65 Kms South East of Junagarh District. The Government notified the large geographical extent of Sasan Gir as wildlife sanctuary on 18th September, 1965 in order to conserve the Asiatic Lion. It covers total area of 1412 square kilometers of which 258 Km forms the core area of the National Park. Indiscriminate hunting by the people of Junagarh led to their decrease in population drastically, while they were completely wiped out from the other parts of Asia. It was the kind effort of Nawabs of Junagarh who protected the queen royalty in his own private hunting grounds. Later in due course of time Department of Forest Officials came forward to protect the world’s most threatened species. From a population of approximately 20 lions in 1913, they have risen to a comfortable 523 according to 2015 census. There are 106 male, 201 female and 213 sub-adult lions in the wilderness of these four districts.<br>

The reconstruction was completed by&nbsp;Vallabhbhai Patel. The site of Somnath has been a pilgrimage site from ancient times on account of being a&nbsp;Triveni sangam&nbsp;(the confluence of three rivers — Kapila, Hiran and&nbsp;Sarasvati. SomaMoon god, is believed to have lost his lustre due to a curse, and he bathed in the Sarasvati River at this site to regain it. The result is the waxing and waning of the moon, no doubt an allusion to the waxing and waning of the tides at this sea shore location. The name of the town&nbsp;Prabhas, meaning lustre, as well as the alternative names&nbsp;Someshvar&nbsp;and&nbsp;Somnath&nbsp;(<span style="font-weight: 700;">“The lord of the moon” or “the moon god”</span>) arise from this tradition<br>
